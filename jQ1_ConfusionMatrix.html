        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-5">
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The confusion matrix is a handy data visualization tool that allows
                    doctors to quickly understand the accuracy of a medical test. It summarizes how often the test
                    correctly identifies healthy and sick patients in a group. As such, it is invaluable for conveying
                    how accurate a test is, and how confident the doctor can be in the test's result. </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Imagine you are an engineer, trying to develop a test that can
                    correctly identify patients that have a disease. In the image to the right, we see an example of a
                    simple confusion matrix that shows the four different outcomes in a patient population. In the rows,
                    we see different types of patients (Healthy and Sick), and in the columns, we see the test results
                    (a Negative Test indicates that the test believes the patient is Healthy, while a Positive Test
                    indicates that the test believes the patient is Sick). Pretty simple right?
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">As an engineer, we have to describe exactly how often the test is
                    correct in its diagnoses. The problem is, there are many different ways that a diagnostic test can
                    be right, and there are just as many ways that it can be wrong. The Confusion Matrix allows us to
                    quickly articulate the relative strenghts and weaknesses of a test in a multitude of scenarios. In
                    the sections to follow, we'll walk through the main pieces of a the confusion matrix and show
                    exactly how handy it can be!

            <h3>Still Confused?</h3>
            In this description, I will be using "sick" to denote people with some "disease" that we are trying to
            identify. In contrast, I will be using "healthy" to denote people without the "disease" that we are trying
            to identify. A "Positive" test is one that says the patient in "sick". When the patient is actually sick,
            this is known as a True Positive. If the patient was healthy and the test incorrectly indicated that they
            were "sick", this is refered to as a "False Positive". In contrast, a "Negative" test

            Wikipedia provides a nice introduction to this topic. Much of this content is taken from here. I'm just
            trying to visualize it in a clearer, more focused approach (link to citation =
            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix).

            There are many different ways to look at this concept. I am going to approach it from the standpoint of a
            diagnostic test. In this example, there is a medical test that is meant to determine if pateints are sick or
            not sick (healthy)?

            Now, there are two piece of of terminology for this situation. The first is "True" vs "False"; and the
            second is "Positive" vs "Negative".

            <p>In a Confusion Matrix, "True" and "False" are meant to refer to correctly getting the write result. For
                instance, the test telling you that you are sick when you are in fact sick. This is pretty intuitive. A
                "true" test is one that returns the correct information while a false test is one that returns the
                incorrect
                result. </p>

            <p>Next, "Positive" vs "Negative". This refers to the result of the test itself. For instance if the test
                returns "sick" that is considered a "positive" result because it found the presence of disease. In
                contrast, a "Negative" test is one that returns a "healthy" </p>

            <p>Unfortunately, there are many different ways you can be wrong in such a simple problem. What if you are
                really good at identifying healthy patients but not really great at identifying when someone is sick?
                Sound confusing, right? If someone isn't healthy, they're automatically sick, right? Yes this is where
                the math doen't really translate well into english (or I am just bad at describing it). Perhaps the
                clearest way to show you this problem is with another example. Let's say there are 10 patients, 5
                healthy and 5 sick. Imagine that this medical test only looks at whether the patient has barfed. Not at
                great test, but stick with me. In this case, the test asks each patient if they've barfed. Even though
                there are 5 sick patients, only 3 have barfed, leaving you with 7 patients (5 healthy and 2 sick) that
                haven't barfed. Guess what, your test is great at identifying healthy people (5 out of 5 healthy people
                found), but not great at telling when a patient is sick (3 out of 5 sick people found). In the
                paragraphs to follow, this test would be considered a very "Specific" test (or a test with high
                specificity) because it is able to accurately identify healthy patients.
            </p>

            <p>In a perfect world, we wouldn't have to care about such things! Every test would be 100% and the only
                things clinicians would need to do was know what tests to order and when. But unfortunately, tests are
                not always accurate and clinicians must always consider the accuracy of the tests they prescribe, and
                the risks that some tests carry for the patients. but unfortunately we have very few perfect tests that
                are able to get it right 100% of the time. Science is still progressing, but in the mean time, we have
                to make trade offs depending upon the resources we have availabilt to us, and what we are trying to
                detect. In truth, sensitivity is not more important thatn specificity or vice versa, it really matters
                what situation you are in and what you are trying to accomplish. Think about pregnancy tests. Is it more
                important to correclty identify a pregnant woman, or be able to definitely tell a woman she is not? we
                have to make trade offs in different situations. </p>

            <p>\(TP = \) True Positives</p>
            <p>\(TN = \) True Negatives</p>
            <p>\(FP = \) False Positives</p>
            <p>\(FN = \) False Negatives</p>

            <p>\(Se = \) Sensitivity</p>
            <p>\(Sp = \) Specificity</p>
            <p>\(PPV = \) Positive Predictive Value</p>
            <p>\(NPV = \) Negative Predictive Value</p>

            Sensitivity (SE)
            $$Se = \frac{TP}{TP+FN}$$
            Specificity (Sp)
            $$Sp = \frac{TN}{TN+FP}$$
            Positive Predictive Value (PPV)
            $$PPV = \frac{TP}{TP+FP}$$
            Negative Predictive Value (NPV)
            $$NPV = \frac{TN}{TN+FN}$$
            Accuracy (Acc)
            $$Acc = \frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FP+FN}$$

            <p>In this context, a sensitive diagnostic test is one that is able to correctly diagnose sick people.</p>
            <p>In this context, a specific diagnostic test is one that is able to correctly identify healthy people.</p>
